Getting Started
===============

Take a look at sample project `TGLStackedViewExample.xcodeproj`.

Usage
=====

Via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org):

* Add `pod 'TGLStackedViewController', '~> 1.0'` to your project's `Podfile`

Or the "classic" way:

* Add files in folder `TGLStackedViewController` to your project

Then in your project:

* Create a derived class from `TGLStackedViewController` and overwrite method `-moveItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:`
* Implement `UICollectionDataSource` (currently only 1 section supported) and `UICollectionViewDelegate` protocols
* Place `UICollectionViewController` in your storyboard and set its class to your derived class

Requirements
============

* ARC
* iOS >= 6.0
* Xcode 5
